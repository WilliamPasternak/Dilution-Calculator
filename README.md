## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript, HTML, CSS
Event listeners grabs the user's form input and inputs into a formula to calculate dilution. 

## Optimizations
- Need to make sure ONLY numbers are accepted. (making all parts required)

- Include pre-defined dilution suggestions.

- Reccomend the average dilution of all users using the site (based on drink style)
ex. Most users diluting 'Stirred Rocks' drinks, dilute to '25%'
